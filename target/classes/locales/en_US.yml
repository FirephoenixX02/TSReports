#⮟ IMPORTANT ⮟

#
# If you want to add your own language to the plugin, then note the following:
#
# 1. be sure that the file has the extension '.yml'.
# 2. be sure that there was no spelling mistake during the transfer
#
# If you now feel confident enough to add your own language,
# then I would recommend you to copy one of the default files and then modify it
#
